HIT 400 2021-2022
So for this capstone design I have come up with two mobile applications the admin(buyers) app and the grower(farmers)app. Since it is intended for android users I have compiled the two applications into apk files that I have add in this repository but however there are some users who may feel to run the system on desktop they need WSL Docker but I have made it to run on cloud.

on the admin app the admin(buyer) firstly has to open the tab for cloud shell in his/her browser since I have deployed the AI model using Cloud shell Platform As A Service(PaaS). using this link https://shell.cloud.google.com/?hl=en_US&fromcloudshell=true&show=terminal&authuser=2&pli=1 and use this email below which I have engaged protossysma@gmail.com, password: boson900#.

Then for the log-in I have used two factor authentication so the admin(buyer) has to enter this email address.Use the following credentials admin@gmail.com, password : 12345678

on the growers app For the login I have used grower number and password use the following credentials V212121, password 12345678

For the data set I have add the seven folders i.e. CL,BF,BL,BR,XF,XL and CF and the main system is in the TBC project made up of the admin app, grower app and the AI model
