## Phishing-Website-Detection

Over the years there have been many attacks of Phishing and many people have lost huge sums of money by becoming a victim of phishing attack. In a phishing attack emails are sent to user claiming to be a legitimate organization, where in the email asks user to enter information like name, telephone, bank account number important passwords etc. such emails direct the user to a website where in user enters these personal information. These websites also known as phishing website now steal the entered user information and carries out
illegal transactions thus causing harm to the user.Phishing website and their mails are sent to millions of users daily and thus are still a big concern for cyber security.


### Overview of the project

Phishing is one of the luring techniques used by phishing artist in the intention of exploiting the personal details of unsuspected users. Phishing website is a mock website that looks similar in appearance but different in destination. The unsuspected users post their data thinking that these websites come from trusted financial institutions. Several antiphishing techniques emerge continuously but phishers come with new technique by breaking all the antiphishing mechanisms. Hence there is a need for efficient mechanism for the prediction of phishing website.
## Introduction

The Internet has become an indispensable part of our life, However, It also has provided opportunities to anonymously perform malicious activities like Phishing. Phishers try to deceive their victims by social engineering or creating mockup websites to steal information such as account ID, username, password from individuals and organizations. Although many methods have been proposed to detect phishing websites, Phishers have evolved their methods to escape from these detection methods. One of the most successful methods for detecting these malicious activities is Machine Learning. This is because most Phishing attacks have some common characteristics which can be identified by machine learning methods.
