notes:
- need for calculation of average seeds required, per hactare, per crop
- need to know the farm's coordinates and its measurements, length and width
- the crops being focused on are visible from an arial space, not under green houses, trees etc
- need to crop each crop's positioning and boundaries on the farm, if there's more that one crop on the farm
- there's a problem of similar plant reflectancy on different crops, even on non crops... the point stated above solves this
- no need for a dataset
