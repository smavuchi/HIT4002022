Cloning process:
-   Make sure you have Git installed on your machine.

-   On the Bitbucket repository page, check on the top part of the screen headed towards the right for a
    button labelled Clone, click on it.

-   Copy the git clone command stated there using the copy button after the command (the button with 2
    mounted squares), or you can manually copy the command.

-   Navigate to your desired project destination folder on your machine eg in your Documents etc.

-   Right click on an empty space and click on Git Bash here , or something along those lines. A git
    terminal should come up.

-   Paste the command you copied earlier into that terminal and press enter. Follow the instructions that 
    come up, you should be prompted to enter your Bitbucket password or to connect your browser login, depends. After you're done with that and the cloning process has been successfully completed, you 
    should see a new folder with your project name inside whatever directory you were in eg your Documents folder etc.

-   After you're done with all the steps stated above, open the new project folder and click on the README
    file inside and follow the stated instructions.
